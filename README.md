# Moore & Mealy Converter

The Moore & Mealy Converter is a Python application built using the Tkinter library for creating a seamless graphical user interface. This application allows users to visualise and convert between Moore and Mealy finite state machines.

## Features:

- **Moore to Mealy Conversion:** Converts a Moore machine to a Mealy machine.
- **Mealy to Moore Conversion:** Converts a Mealy machine to a Moore machine.
- **Graphical Visualization:** Visualizes the state machines using NetworkX and Matplotlib libraries.

## Instructions:

### Launching the Application:

1. Run the Python script `main.py` to launch the application.
2. The main menu offers options for Moore to Mealy and Mealy to Moore conversion.

### Moore to Mealy Conversion:

1. Enter the number of states and transitions for the Moore machine and click "Proceed".
2. Input the outputs for each state and the transition details.
3. Click "Display Moore" to visualise Moore machine.
4. Click "Generate Mealy" to visualise the generated moore machine.

### Mealy to Moore Conversion:

1. Enter the number of states and transitions for the Mealy machine and click "Proceed".
2. Input the output and transition details for each state.
3. Click the "Display Mealy" button to visualise Mealy machine.
4. Click the "Generate Moore" button to visualise the generated Moore machine.

### Graphical Visualization:

- The graphical representation shows states, transitions, and outputs.

## Dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Tkinter
- NetworkX
