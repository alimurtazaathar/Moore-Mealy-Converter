Moore & Mealy Converter

The Moore & Mealy Converter is a Python application built using the Tkinter library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs). This application allows users to visualise and convert between Moore and Mealy finite state machines.

Features:

Moore to Mealy Conversion: Converts a Moore machine to a Mealy machine.
Mealy to Moore Conversion: Converts a Mealy machine to a Moore machine.
Graphical Visualization: Visualizes the state machines using NetworkX and Matplotlib libraries.
Instructions:

Launching the Application:

Run the Python script moore_mealy_converter.py to launch the application.
The main menu offers options for Moore to Mealy and Mealy to Moore conversion.
Moore to Mealy Conversion:

Enter the number of states and transitions for the Moore machine.
Input the outputs for each state and the transition details.
Click "Proceed" to display the Mealy machine graphically.
The generated Mealy machine can be further visualized or converted to Moore.
Mealy to Moore Conversion:

Enter the number of states and transitions for the Mealy machine.
Input the outputs for each state and the transition details.
Click "Proceed" to display the Moore machine graphically.
The generated Mealy machine can be further visualized or converted back to Moore.
Graphical Visualization:

Both Moore and Mealy machines are visualized using NetworkX and Matplotlib libraries.
The graphical representation shows states, transitions, and outputs.
Dependencies:

Python 3.x
Tkinter
NetworkX
Matplotlib
